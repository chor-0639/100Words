                <p id="inf">100Words partners with leading expert mental health education providers around Australia. Your donation can help us support men in local communities and be more formally educated and qualified in how to support their community. As charity and an organisation we strive to try and create a community that men of all ages and join and feel accepted into. Inclusion is important to us as we try to break down any remaining stigma that is around male mental health. Through these donations we can continue to build active networks between men, increase the knowledge base through educational programs and also continue to hold events and functions to raise awareness about our charity and mission.</p>
                <h2 id="whyd2">How does the money help?</h2>
                <p id="inf">Not to be too cliche but it's the truth, every dollar that we receive counts and is valuable to the organisation and all those involved. When you donate through our site you’re helping us reach more and more men who may need the help. <br><br>
We can’t stress enough how grateful we are for your generosity and thank you for being a part of such a great cause.
