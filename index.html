        <h1>OUR <strong>100 WORD</strong> MISSION</h1>
        <p>100 Words Mate to Mate is a charity organisation that focuses on helping men struggling with depression and
            other mental health issues. We strongly believe that communication and support networks are key to helping
            men improve their mental health and quality of life. We feel expressing yourself and your emotions in just
            100 words can help you on your journey to a happier life. <strong>100 Words</strong> looks to connect men
            from all walks of life to increase support networks and give men a space to look after their mental health.
            Your journey to better mental health begins with 100 Words.</p>
